            <a href="https://gigster.com/">Gigster</a> helps companies expand their ability to innovate by building dynamic teams made up of top global freelance talent that create industry-changing custom software. The Gigster Talent Network is comprised of 1k+ highly-skilled developers, project managers, and designers from around the world.</p>
          <p>
            With thoughtful understanding of Gigster's values and needs, Ruamgan developed and refined processes that, in coordination with custom-developed products, allowed Gigster's Staffing Team to achieve 60x reductions in time spent staffing. As a result, the 3-person Staffing Team transformed into Gigster's Network Operations team taking over project onboarding, network growth, network quality, communications, and community with only a single addition to its headcount.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through Gigster's evolution, Ruamgan supported the company providing interim Salesforce administration services as well as technical architecture guidance for Gigster's newest freelancer portal. When Gigster partnered with <a href="https://www.dentsu.com/">Dentsu</a>–the world's largest advertising agency–Ruamgan led technical delivery of Gigster's products, adding full Japanese-language support, and was responsible for training on Network Operations processes.

          <h2>Custom Products</h2>
          <p>
            All of the following products are built on Apps Script allowing Gigster to take advantage G Suite's access controls without having to pay any additional fees for hosting or upkeep.

          <div id="broadcast">
            <h3>Staffing Broadcast & Response</h3>
            <div class="resp-container">
              <iframe class="resp-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/74qWGIGnVE8" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>
              The staffing broadcast tools allow for a huge efficiency gain by providing standardized job data to an automatically filtered list of qualified candidates, while still providing full manual control. If candidates are interested in the jobs, they are guided through a quick application process and instantly connected to the hiring manager for an interview.

          <div id="candidate_management">
            <h3>Staffing Candidate Management</h3>
            <img alt="Screenshot of the Staffing Candidate Management tool." src="../assets/images/candidate_management_1.png">
            <p>
              Having to hire at least 5 people for a single project can easily become an organizational mess leading to uncaptured data and bad experiences for the candidates. At Gigster, hiring managers commonly work on multiple projects simultaneously. The Staffing Candidate Management tool allows them to clearly navigate through their pending projects and candidates.

            <h3>Project Onboarding</h3>
            <img alt="Screenshot of the Project Onboarding tool." src="../assets/images/project_onboarding_1.png">
            <p>
              Paperwork is a requirement at the conclusion of any staffing process. The Project Onboarding tool allows Gigster to easily gather project scope and payout data and send it to the freelancer for electronic acceptance.

            <p>
              One of the most challenging aspects of Network Operations is in predicting the future demands on Gigster's Talent Network, e.g. are there enough Swift developers available to staff on upcoming projects? Ruamgan developed models to predict hourly usage of freelancer resources as well as estimations of future staffing needs informed by the sales pipeline. As of yet, Gigster has never lost a sale due to lack of freelancer resources.
